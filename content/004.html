                        <p>Fortunately there's a trick to get round this problem.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a new sprite (it doesn't matter what it looks like, we'll delete it in just a moment)</li>
                            <li>Grab a <span class="sensing hex">touching <span>mouse-pointer</span></span> and change it to <span class="sensing hex">touching <span>Sprite1</span></span></li> (note: we have that option now, because we're in a new sprite)
                            <li>Use Ctrl + C to copy this code block, click back to Sprite1, and use Ctrl + V to paste it into Sprite1's code area</li>
                            <li>Delete the new sprite you just created</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now that you have the <span class="sensing hex">touching <span>Sprite1</span></span> block that you need, add some code to delete a newly created sprite if it overlaps another:</p>
